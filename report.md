We study a general bipartite quantum system consisting of a spin interacting with a bosonic field, with the initial state prepared as the product of a spin coherent state and a canonical coherent state. Our goal is to develop a semiclassical framework to describe the entanglement dynamics between these two subsystems. Using appropriate approximations, we derive a semiclassical expression for the entanglement entropy that depends exclusively on the trajectories of the underlying classical description. By analytically extending the classical phase space into the complex domain, we identify…

The Thirring model in 2+1$d$ with $N$ Dirac flavors can exhibit spontaneous U($2N)\to$U($N)\otimes$U($N$) breaking through fermion - antifermion condensation in the limit $m\to0$. With no small parameter in play the symmetry-breaking dynamics is strongly-interacting and quantitative work requires a fermion formulation accurately capturing global symmetries. We present simulation results for $N=1$ obtained with Wilson kernel domain wall fermions on $16^3\times L_s$, with $L_s=24,\ldots,120$. The $L_s\to\infty$ extrapolation of the bilinear condensate $\langle\barψψ\rangle$ as a function of…

We define Deligne-Beilinson (DB) cohomology on a cubic lattice and use it to formulate and analyze lattice $U(1)$ Chern-Simons theory at even levels. The continuum DB cohomology provides a refined mathematical framework for continuum $U(1)$ connections constructed in a patchwise manner. The lattice DB cohomology we construct retains many essential properties of the continuum DB cohomology and naturally incorporates a notion of self-linking number. The lattice $U(1)$ Chern-Simons action formulated using the lattice DB cohomology is expressed as a simple quadratic form via the star product,…

Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) holds unique value in real-world surveillance bridging visual perception and language understanding, yet current paradigms utilizing pre-training models often fail to transfer effectively to complex open-world scenarios. The reliance on "Passive Observation" leads to multifaceted spurious correlations and spatial semantic misalignment, causing a lack of robustness against distribution shifts. To fundamentally resolve these defects, this paper proposes ICON (Invariant Counterfactual Optimization with Neuro-symbolic priors), a framework integrating causal and…

## 5. Classical Simulation of Noiseless Quantum Dynamics without Randomness

Simulating noiseless quantum dynamics classically faces a fundamental dilemma: tensor-network methods become inefficient as entanglement saturates, while Pauli-truncation approaches typically rely on noise or randomness. To close the gap, we propose the Low-weight Pauli Dynamics (LPD) algorithm that efficiently approximates local observables for short-time dynamics in the absence of noise. We prove that the truncation error admits an average-case bound without assuming randomness, provided that the state is sufficiently entangled. Counterintuitively, entanglement--usually an obstacle for…
