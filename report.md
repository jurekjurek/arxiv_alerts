The charged moments of a reduced density matrix provide a natural starting point for deriving symmetry-resolved Rényi and entanglement entropies, which quantify how entanglement is distributed among symmetry sectors in the presence of a global internal symmetry in a quantum many-body system. In this work, we study charged moments within the framework of Ballistic Fluctuation Theory (BFT). This theory describes large-scale ballistic fluctuations of conserved charges and associated currents and, by exploiting the height-field formulation of twist fields, gives access to the asymptotic behaviour…

Space-based distribution of quantum entanglement will be essential for global quantum networking and secure communications. Modelling and analysis of the performance of satellite entanglement pair distribution is important for the architecture and design of constellations and space systems. Entanglement-based quantum key distribution, in the absence of quantum repeaters, is especially prone to finite key effects due to low coincident count rates compared to trusted node single-path links. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive study of finite-key effects in the context of direct dual…

Distributed architectures are gaining prominence in quantum machine learning as a means to overcome hardware limitations and enable scalable quantum information processing. In this context, we analyze the design and performance of distributed Quantum Extreme Learning Machine (QELM) architectures for learning functions of quantum states directly from data, restricting measurements to easily implementable projective measurements in the computational basis. The aim is to determine which schemes can effectively recover specific properties of input quantum states, including both linear and…

Certification is important to guarantee the correct functioning of quantum devices. A key certification task is verifying that a device has produced a desired output state. In this work, we study this task in the context of photonic platforms, where single photons are propagated through linear optical interferometers to create large, entangled resource states for metrology, communication, quantum advantage demonstrations and for so-called linear optical quantum computing (LOQC). This setting derives its computational power from the indistinguishability of the photons, i.e., their relative…

Spin networks in Loop Quantum Gravity are traditionally described by unitary holonomies corresponding to noiseless transformations. In this work, we extend this framework to incorporate general quantum channels that model effects of environment, which can become significant at the Planck scale. Specifically, we demonstrate that the transformation properties of Kraus operators, which define completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) maps, are consistent with the gauge invariance of spin networks. This enables the introduction of generalized spin network states that can be expressed in terms…

## 6. Scalable Preparation of Matrix Product States with Sequential and Brick Wall Quantum Circuits

Preparing arbitrary quantum states requires exponential resources. Matrix Product States (MPS) admit more efficient constructions, particularly when accuracy is traded for circuit complexity. Existing approaches to MPS preparation mostly rely on heuristic circuits that are deterministic but quickly saturate in accuracy, or on variational optimization methods that reach high fidelities but scale poorly. This work introduces an end-to-end MPS preparation framework that combines the strengths of both strategies within a single pipeline. Heuristic staircase-like and brick wall disentangler…

Quantum subspace diagonalization and quantum Krylov algorithms offer a feasible, pre- or early-fault tolerant alternative to quantum phase estimation for using quantum computers to estimate the low-lying spectra of quantum systems. However, despite promising proof-of-principle results, such methods suffer from high sensitivity to noise (including intrinsic sources such as sampling noise), making their utility for realistic industry-relevant problems an open question. To improve the potential applicability of such methods, we introduce a new variant of thresholding for noisy generalized…

The logistics industry is widely regarded as a promising application domain for emerging optimization paradigms, including quantum computing. The Rider-Order Assignment problem is a practically motivated optimization problem arising in online food delivery and related logistics applications. While the problem is closely related to the classical matching problem, the inclusion of realistic operational constraints renders it computationally challenging. In this work, we formulate the Rider-Order Assignment problem as a constrained binary optimization problem and perform a comparative analysis…

## 9. A$^{2}$V-SLP: Alignment-Aware Variational Modeling for Disentangled Sign Language Production

Building upon recent structural disentanglement frameworks for sign language production, we propose A$^{2}$V-SLP, an alignment-aware variational framework that learns articulator-wise disentangled latent distributions rather than deterministic embeddings. A disentangled Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encodes ground-truth sign pose sequences and extracts articulator-specific mean and variance vectors, which are used as distributional supervision for training a non-autoregressive Transformer. Given text embeddings, the Transformer predicts both latent means and log-variances, while the VAE…

Multi-modal recommendation has gained traction as items possess rich attributes like text and images. Semantic ID-based approaches effectively discretize this information into compact tokens. However, two challenges persist: (1) Suboptimal Tokenization: existing methods (e.g., RQ-VAE) lack disentanglement between shared cross-modal semantics and modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse; (2) Architecture-Data Mismatch: vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchy of user interactions, items, and tokens. Expanding items into multiple tokens…

A hybrid quantum computing architecture combining quantum processors and quantum memory units allows for exploiting each component's unique properties to enhance the overall performance of the total system. However, superconducting qubits are highly sensitive to magnetic fields, while spin ensembles require finite fields for control, creating a major integration challenge. In this work, we demonstrate the first experimental setup that satisfies these constraints and provides verified qubit stability. Our cryogenic setup comprises two spatially and magnetically decoupled sample volumes inside…

We map the phase diagram of a two-mode atom-molecule Bose-Einstein condensate with Fano-Feshbach and coherent three-body recombination (cTBR) terms. The standard second order phase transition observed as the molecular energy is tuned through the Feshbach resonance, is replaced by a first order transition when cTBR becomes prominent, due to a double-well structure in the free energy landscape. This transition is associated with atom-molecule entanglement, bistability, and molecular metastability. Our results establish cTBR as a powerful knob for quantum state engineering and control of…
