In an entanglement summoning task, a set of distributed, co-operating parties attempt to fulfill requests to prepare entanglement between distant locations. The parties share limited communication resources: timing constraints may require the entangled state be prepared before some pairs of distant parties can communicate, and a restricted set of links in a quantum network may further constrain communication. Building on earlier work, we continue the characterization of entanglement summoning. We give an if and only if condition on entanglement summoning tasks with only bidirected causal…

The space $\mathrm{Inv}(j_1,j_2,j_3,j_4)$ of SU(2)-invariant four-valent tensors, also known as intertwiners, can be understood as the quantum states of a tetrahedron in Euclidean space with fixed areas. In loop quantum gravity, they are states of the smallest "atom of space" with non-zero volume. At the same time they correspond to four-party tensor product states invariant under global rotations. We consider the multipartite entanglement of states in $\mathrm{Inv}(j_1,j_2,j_3,j_4)$ using the recently proposed entropic fill. Numerically evaluating entropic fill in the case of equal spins…

## 3. On Distributed Quantum Computing with Distributed Fan-Out Operations

We compare different circuits implementing distributed versions of quantum computations, using entangled pairs only, and using distributed fan-out operations (using GHZ states). We highlight the advantages of using distributed fan-out operations in terms of reductions in circuit depth and (possibly) entanglement resources. We note that distributed fan-out operations (or notably, distributed GHZ states) could be a ``primitive'' building block for distributed quantum operations in the same way as entangled pairs are, if distributed GHZ states could be realized efficiently.

## 4. Combatting noise in near-term quantum data centres

We analyse the performance of different error handling methods in the quantum data centre paradigm of distributed quantum computing. We compare the impact of quantum error detection, using the three-qubit repetition code and the [[4, 1, 2]] Leung-Nielsen-Chuang-Yamamoto code, on remote gates with that of conventional entanglement distillation techniques. Detailed classical simulation is used to obtain results for realistic near-term hardware.

We present QDK/Chemistry, a software toolkit for quantum chemistry workflows targeting quantum computers. The toolkit addresses a key challenge in the field: while quantum algorithms for chemistry have matured considerably, the infrastructure connecting classical electronic structure calculations to quantum circuit execution remains fragmented. QDK/Chemistry provides this infrastructure through a modular architecture that separates data representations from computational methods, enabling researchers to compose workflows from interchangeable components. In addition to providing native…

Leveraging a recently proposed notion of relative entropy in general probabilistic theories (GPT), we prove a finite de Finetti representation theorem for general convex bodies. We apply this result to address a fundamental question in polynomial optimization: the existence of a convergent outer hierarchy for problems with inequality constraints and analytical convergence guarantees. Our strategy generalizes a quantitative monogamy-of-entanglement argument from quantum theory to arbitrary convex bodies, establishing a uniform upper bound on mutual information in multipartite extensions. This…

## 7. Explaining the advantage of quantum-enhanced physics-informed neural networks

Partial differential equations (PDEs) form the backbone of simulations of many natural phenomena, for example in climate modeling, material science, and even financial markets. The application of physics-informed neural networks to accelerate the solution of PDEs is promising, but not competitive with numerical solvers yet. Here, we show how quantum computing can improve the ability of physics-informed neural networks to solve partial differential equations. For this, we develop hybrid networks consisting of quantum circuits combined with classical layers and systematically test them on…

## 8. Emergent, not Immanent: A Baradian Reading of Explainable AI

Explainable AI (XAI) is frequently positioned as a technical problem of revealing the inner workings of an AI model. This position is affected by unexamined onto-epistemological assumptions: meaning is treated as immanent to the model, the explainer is positioned outside the system, and a causal structure is presumed recoverable through computational techniques. In this paper, we draw on Barad's agential realism to develop an alternative onto-epistemology of XAI. We propose that interpretations are material-discursive performances that emerge from situated entanglements of the AI model with…

## 9. Cavity-QED tools for MBQC with optical binomial-codes

Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) offers a promising paradigm for photonic quantum computing, but its implementation requires the generation of specific non-Gaussian resource states. While continuous-variable encodings such as the highly complex (GKP) states have been widely studied, the much simpler binomial codes offer an experimentally accessible alternative, though they demand a distinct set of operational tools. Here, we present a toolkit for MBQC using optical binomial codes, detailing a cavity-QED protocol for conditional generation of cluster states and the implementation…

## 10. Testing the equivalence to thermal states via extractable work under LOCC

Understanding the thermal behavior of quantum many-body pure states is one of the most fundamental issues in quantum thermodynamics. It is widely known that typical pure states yield vanishing work, just as thermal states do, when one restricts to local operations that cannot access correlations among subsystems. However, it remains unclear whether this equivalence to thermal states persists under LOCC (local operations and classical communication), where classically accessible correlations can be exploited for work extraction. In this work, we establish criteria for determining whether…

In this paper, we develop a blended dynamics framework for open quantum networks with diffusive couplings. The network consists of qubits interconnected through Hamiltonian couplings, environmental dissipation, and consensus-like diffusive interactions. Such networks commonly arise in spontaneous emission processes and non-Hermitian quantum computing, and their evolution follows a Lindblad master equation. Blended dynamics theory is well established in the classical setting as a tool for analyzing emergent behaviors in heterogeneous networks with diffusive couplings. Its key insight is to…

Integrated optical microresonators exploiting either second-order ($χ^{(2)}$) or third-order ($χ^{(3)}$) nonlinearities have become key platforms for frequency conversion, low-noise microwave photonics, and quantum entanglement generation. Here, we present an analytic theory of Kerr-enhanced three-wave mixing amplification in an electro-optic microresonator with both $χ^{(2)}$ and $χ^{(3)}$ nonlinearities. We demonstrate that Kerr dressing hybridizes the optical sidebands, renormalizing the $χ^{(2)}$ couplings and detunings. As a result the system exhibits gain in regions where analogous bare…
