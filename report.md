We investigate the process of quantum teleportation in an expanding universe modeled by Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime, focusing on two cosmologically relevant scenarios: a power-law expansion and the de Sitter universe. Adopting a field-theoretical approach, we analyze the quantum correlations between two comoving observers who share an entangled mode of a scalar field. Using the Bogoliubov transformation, we compute the teleportation fidelity and examine its dependence on the expansion rate, initial entanglement, and the mode frequency. Our findings indicate that spacetime curvature…

## 2. Entangled photon pair excitation and time-frequency filtered multidimensional photon correlation spectroscopy as a probe for dissipative exciton kinetics

In molecular aggregates, multiple delocalized exciton states interact with phonons, making the state-resolved spectroscopic monitoring of dynamics challenging. We propose a protocol that combines photon-entanglement-enhanced narrowband excitation of two-exciton states with time-frequency-filtered two-photon coincidence counting. It can alleviate bottlenecks associated with probing exciton dynamics spread across multiple spectral and temporal windows. We demonstrate that non-classical correlations of entangled photon pairs can be used to prepare narrowband two-exciton population distributions,…

We propose a co-designed variant of ADAPT-VQE (Co-ADAPT-VQE) where the quantum hardware is taken into account in the construction of the ansatz. This framework can be readily used to optimize state preparation circuits for any device, addressing shortcomings such as limited connectivity, short coherence times, and variable gate errors. We exemplify the impact of Co-ADAPT-VQE by creating state preparation circuits for devices with linear nearest-neighbor (LNN) connectivity. We show a reduction of the CNOT count of the final circuits by up to 97% for 12-14 qubit systems, with the impact being…

Nonclassical states of light and their correlations lie at the heart of quantum optics, serving as fundamental resources that underpin both the exploration of quantum phenomena and the realisation of quantum information protocols. These lecture notes provide an accessible yet rigorous introduction to the foundations of quantum optics, emphasising their relevance to quantum information science and technology. Starting from the quantisation of the electromagnetic field and the bosonic formalism of Fock space, the notes develop a unified framework for describing and analysing quantum states of…

## 5. Scalable Multi-QPU Circuit Design for Dicke State Preparation: Optimizing Communication Complexity and Local Circuit Costs

Preparing large-qubit Dicke states is of broad interest in quantum computing and quantum metrology. However, the number of qubits available on a single quantum processing unit (QPU) is limited -- motivating the distributed preparation of such states across multiple QPUs as a practical approach to scalability. In this article, we investigate the distributed preparation of $n$-qubit $k$-excitation Dicke states $D(n,k)$ across a general number $p$ of QPUs, presenting a distributed quantum circuit (each QPU hosting approximately $\lceil n/p \rceil$ qubits) that prepares the state with…
