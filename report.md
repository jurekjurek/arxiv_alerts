We consider the problem of covert communication over the entanglement-assisted (EA) bosonic multiple access channel (MAC). We derive a closed-form achievable rate region for the general EA bosonic MAC using high-order phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the low-photon regime the capacity region collapses into a rectangle, asymptotically matching the point-to-point capacity as multi-user interference vanishes. We also characterize an achievable covert throughput region, showing that entanglement assistance enables an aggregate throughput scaling of…

Quantum machine learning (QML) models often require deep, parameterized circuits to capture complex frequency components, limiting their scalability and near-term implementation. We introduce \textit{Quantum Random Features} (QRF) and \textit{Quantum Dynamical Random Features} (QDRF), lightweight quantum reservoir models inspired by classical random Fourier features (RFF) that generate high-dimensional spectral representations without variational optimization. Using $Z$-rotation encoding combined with random permutations or Hamiltonian dynamics, these models achieve $N_f$-dimensional feature…

We study how energy and quantum entanglement are transferred when two identical CFTs are entangled locally. This is probed by considering a local operator insertion in one of the CFTs. When the CFTs have holographic duals via the AdS/CFT correspondence, the transfer happens through an AdS wormhole that allows signal propagation even beyond the horizon from one AdS boundary to the other; we demonstrate this in explicit CFT calculations. We argue that this transmission is possible because the insertion of a local operator is not a unitary process but a regularized version of projection…

It is a matter of ongoing discussion whether quantum states can become entangled while only interacting via a classical mediator. This lively debate is deeply interwoven with the question of whether entanglement studies can prove the quantum nature of gravity. However, the answer to this fundamental question depends crucially on which hybrid quantum-classical theory is used. In this letter, we demonstrate that entanglement by a classical mediator is possible within the framework of hybrid van Hove theory, showing that existing no-go theorems on that matter do not universally apply to hybrid…

High-coherence, fault-tolerant and scalable quantum computing architectures with unprecedented long coherence times, faster gates, low losses and low bit-flip errors may be one of the only ways forward to achieve the true quantum advantage. In this context, high-frequency high-coherence (HCQC) qubits with new high-performance topologies could be a significant step towards efficient and high-fidelity quantum computing by facilitating compact size, higher scalability and higher than conventional operating temperatures. Although transmon type qubits are designed and manufactured routinely in the…

In this dissertation, resonator-based readout techniques were developed for floating electrons as qubits on cryogenic substrates, using two platforms: electrons on liquid helium and electrons on solid neon. In addition, a cryogenic microwave source was developed to enable low-noise measurement for qubit readout.

Interacting spin systems in solids underpin a wide range of quantum technologies, from quantum sensors and single-photon sources to spin-defect-based quantum registers and processors. We develop a quantum-computer-aided framework for simulating such devices using a general electron spin resonance Hamiltonian incorporating zero-field splitting, the Zeeman effect, hyperfine interactions, dipole-dipole spin-spin terms, and electron-phonon decoherence. Within this model, we combine Gray-encoded qudit-to-qubit mappings, qubit-wise commuting aggregation, and a multi-reference selected quantum…

Decomposing complex data into factorized representations can reveal reusable components and enable synthesizing new samples via component recombination. We investigate this in the context of diffusion-based models that learn factorized latent spaces without factor-level supervision. In images, factors can capture background, illumination, and object attributes; in robotic videos, they can capture reusable motion components. To improve both latent factor discovery and quality of compositional generation, we introduce an adversarial training signal via a discriminator trained to distinguish…

Quantum machine learning (QML) is often listed as a promising candidate for useful applications of quantum computers, in part due to numerous proofs of possible quantum advantages. A central question is how small a role quantum computers can play while still enabling provable learning advantages over classical methods. We study an especially restricted setting in which a quantum computer is used only as a feature extractor: it acts independently on individual data points, without access to labels or global dataset information, is available only to augment the training set, and is not…

Distance metrics are central to machine learning, yet distances between ensembles of quantum states remain poorly understood due to fundamental quantum measurement constraints. We introduce a hierarchy of integral probability metrics, termed MMD-$k$, which generalizes the maximum mean discrepancy to quantum ensembles and exhibit a strict trade-off between discriminative power and statistical efficiency as the moment order $k$ increases. For pure-state ensembles of size $N$, estimating MMD-$k$ using experimentally feasible SWAP-test-based estimators requires $Θ(N^{2-2/k})$ samples for constant…

Protecting quantum information through quantum error correction (QEC) is a cornerstone of future fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, current QEC-protected logical qubits have only achieved coherence times about twice those of their best physical constituents. Here, we show that the primary barrier to higher QEC gains is ancilla-induced operational errors rather than intrinsic cavity coherence. To overcome this bottleneck, we introduce error-detectable universal control of bosonic modes, wherein ancilla relaxation events are detected and the corresponding trajectories discarded,…

Decoders are a critical component of fault-tolerant quantum computing. They must identify errors based on syndrome measurements to correct quantum states. While finding the optimal correction is NP-hard and thus extremely difficult, approximate decoders with faster runtime often rely on uncontrolled heuristics. In this work, we propose a family of hierarchical quantum decoders with a tunable trade-off between speed and accuracy while retaining guarantees of optimality. We use the Lasserre Sum-of-Squares (SOS) hierarchy from optimization theory to relax the decoding problem. This approach…

Disentangled representation learning aims to map independent factors of variation to independent representation components. On one hand, purely unsupervised approaches have proven successful on fully disentangled synthetic data, but fail to recover semantic factors from real data without strong inductive biases. On the other hand, supervised approaches are unstable and hard to scale to large attribute sets because they rely on adversarial objectives or auxiliary classifiers. We introduce \textsc{XFactors}, a weakly-supervised VAE framework that disentangles and provides explicit control over…

Strassen's asymptotic spectrum offers a framework for analyzing the complexity of tensors. It has found applications in diverse areas, from computer science to additive combinatorics and quantum information. A long-standing open problem, dating back to 1991, asks whether Strassen's support functionals are universal spectral points, that is, points in the asymptotic spectrum of tensors. In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative by proving that the support functionals coincide with the quantum functionals - universal spectral points that are defined via entropy optimization on…

Benchmarking physical devices and verifying logical algorithms are important tasks for scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing. Numerous protocols exist for benchmarking devices before running actual algorithms. In this work, we show that both physical and logical errors of fault-tolerant circuits can even be characterized in-situ using syndrome data. To achieve this, we map general fault-tolerant Clifford circuits to subsystem codes using the spacetime code formalism and develop a scheme for estimating Pauli noise in Clifford circuits using syndrome data. We give necessary and sufficient…

Advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have inspired time series understanding and reasoning tasks, that enable natural language querying over time series, producing textual analyses of complex temporal dynamics. Recent attempts hybridize numerical time series with their visualized plots, facilitating precise value reasoning and visual structure comprehension for comprehensive time series understanding of MLLMs. However, effective cross-modal integration remains challenging due to fine-grained temporal misalignment across modalities and severe entanglement between shared and…
