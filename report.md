Multipartite entanglement determines the strength and range of interactions in many-body quantum systems. Yet, it is hard to evaluate it, due to the complex structures of quantum states. Here, we introduce a generic method to quantify the k <= N-partite entanglement of an N-particle system, by maximizing an arbitrary bipartite entanglement measure within subsystems of size up to k. The resulting classification of multipartite states captures their experimental cost: creating a k-partite entangled state requires at least k-1 two-particle entangling gates. Further, we analytically calculate the…

Coordination in distributed systems is often hampered by communication latency, which degrades performance. Quantum entanglement offers fundamentally stronger correlations than classically achievable without communication. Crucially, these correlations manifest instantaneously upon measurement, irrespective of the physical distance separating the systems. We investigate the application of shared entanglement to a dual-work optimization problem in a distributed system comprising two servers. The system must process both a continuously available, preemptible baseline task and incoming customer…

## 3. Effect of initial intrasystem entanglement on entropy growth in generalized Jaynes-Cummings models

We investigate how initial intrasystem entanglement influences the entropy generated in atomic systems interacting with a photonic environment in several generalizations of the Jaynes-Cummings model with two or more subsystems. Since the initial entanglement does not uniquely determine the final entropy, we focus on ensemble-averaged behavior. We consider ensembles of initial system states including pure and mixed Haar-random states, ensembles with fixed average energy or fixed mixedness, and varying initial photon numbers in the environment. In all cases, we observe a positive correlation…

Instanton liquid model is believed to capture the main features of vacuum QCD dynamics. Recently, multiple predictions for hadron structure functions have been derived and compared with experimental measurements and lattice QCD calculations, finding a general agreement. In order to explore the precision of the instanton liquid model, one has to compare its predictions with non-perturbative simulations in a regime dominated by instanton dynamics. This has been performed for two gluon-sensitive observables: the gluon Green's function and the strong running coupling constant. In this…

Entanglement is a central resource in quantum information and quantum technologies, yet its characterization remains challenging due to both theoretical complexity and measurement requirements. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling entanglement characterization from incomplete measurement data, however model interpretability remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce a unified and interpretable framework for SLOCC entanglement classification of two- and three-qubit states, encompassing both pure and mixed states. We train dense and convolutional neural…

It is known that when a system interacts with its environment, the entanglement contained in the system is redistributed since parts of the system entangle with the environment. On the other hand, the entanglement of a system with its environment is closely related to the entropy of the system. However, does this imply that the entropy of systems with larger internal entanglement will grow stronger? We study the issue using the simplest model as an example: a system of qubits interacts with the environment described by the quantum harmonic oscillator. The answer to the posed question is…

We present a quantum computing framework for VLBI data correlation. We point out that a classical baseband time series data of length $N$ can be embedded into a quantum superposition state using amplitude encoding with only $\log_2 N$ qubits. The basic VLBI correlation and fringe fitting operations, including fringe rotation, Fourier transform, delay compensation, and cross correlation, can be implemented via quantum algorithms with significantly reduced computational complexity. We construct a full quantum processing pipeline and validate its feasibility and accuracy through direct…

Variational quantum algorithms are practical approaches to prepare ground states, but their potential for quantum advantage remains unclear. Here, we use differentiable 2D tensor networks (TN) to optimize parameterized quantum circuits that prepare the ground state of the transverse field Ising model (TFIM). Our method enables the preparation of states with high energy accuracy, even for large systems beyond 1D. We show that TN pre-optimization can mitigate the barren plateau issue by giving access to enhanced gradient zones that do not shrink exponentially with system size. We evaluate the…

The superconducting qubit quantum computer is one of the most promising quantum computing architectures for large-scale integration due to its maturity and close proximity to the well-established semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure. From an education perspective, it also bridges classical microwave electronics and quantum electrodynamics. In this paper, we will review the basics of quantum computers, superconductivity, and Josephson junctions. We then introduce important technologies and concepts related to DiVincenzo's criteria, which are the necessary conditions for the…

The adaptive derivative-assembled pseudo-trotter variational quantum eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) is a promising hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for molecular ground state energy calculation, yet its practical scalability is hampered by redundant excitation operators and excessive measurement costs. To address these challenges, we propose Param-ADAPT-VQE, a novel improved algorithm that selects excitation operators based on a parameter-based criterion instead of the traditional gradient-based metric. This strategy effectively eludes redundant operators. We further develop a sub-Hamiltonian…

We investigate the hardware requirements for quantum teleportation in an intercity-scale network topology consisting of two metropolitan-scale networks connected via a long-distance backbone link. Specifically, we identify the minimal improvements required beyond the state-of-the-art to achieve an end-to-end expected teleportation fidelity of $2/3$, which represents the classical limit. To this end, we formulate the hardware requirements computation as optimisation problems, where the hardware parameters representing the underlying device capabilities serve as decision variables. Assuming a…

True self-evolution requires agents to act as lifelong learners that internalize novel experiences to solve future problems. However, rigorously measuring this foundational capability is hindered by two obstacles: the entanglement of prior knowledge, where ``new'' knowledge may appear in pre-training data, and the entanglement of reasoning complexity, where failures may stem from problem difficulty rather than an inability to recall learned knowledge. We introduce SE-Bench, a diagnostic environment that obfuscates the NumPy library and its API doc into a pseudo-novel package with randomized…

Quantum computing promises to revolutionize several scientific and technological domains through fundamentally new ways of processing information. Among its most compelling applications is digital quantum simulation, where quantum computers are used to replicate the behavior of other quantum systems. This could enable the study of problems that are otherwise intractable on classical computers, transforming fields such as quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics, and materials science. Despite this potential, realizations of practical quantum advantage for relevant problems are hindered by…

The realization of high-fidelity quantum control is crucial for quantum information processing, particularly in noisy environments where control strategies must simultaneously achieve precise manipulation and effective noise suppression. Conventional optimal control designs typically requires numerical calculations of the system dynamics. Recent studies have demonstrated that long short-term memory neural networks (LSTM-NNs) can accurately predict the time evolution of open quantum systems. Based on LSTM-NN predicted dynamics, we propose an optimal control framework for rapid and efficient…

An influence of environment on quantum correlations (entanglement and quantum discord) is studied in a two-spin-1/2 system with dipole-dipole interactions on the basis of Lindblad equation. We consider the simplest case when the environment causes only dephasing of system spins. The dependencies of entanglement and the quantum discord on the relaxation rate are obtained. We compare the influence of the environment on entanglement and quantum discord.

Kolmogorov's foundation of probability takes measure spaces, $σ$-algebras, and probability measures as basic objects. It is, however, widely recognized that this classical framework is inadequate for random phenomena involving quantum effects, and more generally for \emph{quantum-like} situations. A broader formulation is provided by an algebraic viewpoint: one starts from an algebra of random variables equipped with a distinguished linear functional -- the \emph{state} -- interpreted as expectation. In this sense, the approach can also be viewed as a modern reading of ideas already implicit…
