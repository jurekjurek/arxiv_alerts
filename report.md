We present a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) approach for solving the Anderson Impurity Model (AIM) arising in Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT). Recognizing that the minimal two-site approximation often fails to resolve essential spectral features, we investigate the efficacy of VQE for larger bath discretizations while adhering to near-term hardware constraints. We employ a symmetry-adapted ansatz enforcing conservation of particle number $(N)$, spin projection $(S_z=0)$, and total spin $(S^2=0)$ symmetry, benchmarking the performance against exact diagonalization across different…

Quantum computers connected through classical and quantum communication channels can be combined to function as a single unit to run large quantum circuits that each device is unable to execute on their own. The distributed quantum computing paradigm is therefore often seen as a potential pathway to scaling quantum computing to capacities necessary for practical and large-scale applications. Whether connecting multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) in clusters or over networks, quantum communication requires entanglement to be generated and distributed over distances. Using entanglement,…

In the three-flavor neutrino oscillation framework, we investigate the transition probabilities of an initial muon neutrino flavor state in the presence of non-standard interactions (NSIs) characterized by complex off-diagonal ($|ε_{αβ}|e^{iφ_{αβ}}$) and diagonal parameters ($|ε_{αα}-ε_{ββ}|$), including a CP-violating phase and a constant matter potential, under both normal (NO) and inverted mass ordering (IO) scenarios. Within these scenarios and through the lens of mode entanglement, bipartite entanglement measures such as entanglement entropy and capacity of entanglement are quantified in…

We report the generation of quantum entanglement between the center-of-mass motion of a levitated nanosphere, coupled by coherent scattering to an optical cavity mode, and the electromagnetic field. Using heterodyne detection, we reconstruct the full set of optical-mechanical correlations and observe a violation of separability bounds between the mechanical degrees of freedom and the propagating optical mode. Thus, we demonstrate the ability to distribute nonclassical correlations beyond the interaction region. Our results are obtained at room temperature and are robust over a broad range of…

## 5. Quantum Computing for Electronic Circular Dichroism Spectrum Prediction of Chiral Molecules

Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy captures the chiroptical response of molecules, enabling absolute configuration assignment that is vital for enantioselective synthesis and drug design. The practical use of ECD spectra in predictive modeling remains restricted, as existing approaches offer limited confidence for chiral discrimination. By contrast, theoretical ECD calculations demand substantial computational effort rooted in electronic structure theory, which constrains their scalability to larger chemically diverse molecules. These limitations underscore the need for…

The effective Hamiltonian serves as the conceptual pivot of quantum engineering, transforming physical complexity into programmable logic; yet, its construction remains compromised by the mathematical non-uniqueness of block diagonalization, which introduces an intrinsic "gauge freedom" that standard methods fail to resolve. We address this by establishing the Least Action Unitary Transformation (LAUT) as the fundamental principle for effective models. By minimizing geometric action, LAUT guarantees dynamical fidelity and inherently enforces the preservation of symmetries--properties…

We theoretically explore protocols for measuring the spin polarization of an ensemble of solid-state spins, with precision at or below the standard quantum limit. Such measurements in the solid-state are challenging, as standard approaches based on optical fluorescence are often limited by poor readout fidelity. Indirect microwave resonator-mediated measurements provide an attractive alternative, though a full analysis of relevant sources of measurement noise is lacking. In this work we study dispersive readout of an inhomogeneously broadened spin ensemble via coupling to a driven resonator…

Magnons are the low-energy excitations of magnetically ordered materials. While the magnetic moment of a ferromagnet aligns with an applied magnetic field, it has been experimentally shown that the magnetic order can be inverted by injecting spin current into the magnet. This results in an energetically unstable but dynamically stabilized state where the magnetic moment aligns antiparallel to an applied magnetic field, called the inverted magnetic state. The excitations on top of such a state have negative energy and are called antimagnons. The inverted state is subject to fluctuations, in…

Large language models (LLMs) can generate structured artifacts, but using them as dependable optimizers for scientific design requires a mechanism for iterative improvement under black-box evaluation. Here, we cast quantum circuit synthesis as a closed-loop, test-time optimization problem: an LLM proposes edits to a fixed-length gate list, and an external simulator evaluates the resulting state with the Meyer-Wallach (MW) global entanglement measure. We introduce a lightweight test-time learning recipe that can reuse prior high-performing candidates as an explicit memory trace, augments…

In fault-tolerant quantum computing, soft outputs from real-time decoders play a crucial role in improving decoding accuracy, post-selecting magic states, and accelerating lattice surgery. A recent paper by Meister et al. [arXiv:2405.07433 (2024)] proposed an efficient method to evaluate soft outputs for cluster-based decoders, including the Union-Find (UF) decoder. However, in parallel computing environments, its computational complexity is comparable to or even surpasses that of the UF decoder itself, resulting in a substantial overhead. Furthermore, this method requires global information…

The variational quantum algorithm (VQA) with a parametrized quantum circuit is widely applicable to near-term quantum computing, but its fundamental issues that limit optimization performance have been reported in the literature. For example, VQA optimization often suffers from vanishing gradients called barren plateau (BP) and the presence of local minima in the landscape of the cost function. Numerical studies have shown that the trap in local minima is significantly reduced when the circuit is overparametrized (OP), where the number of parameters exceeds a certain threshold. Theoretical…

Quantum chaos is commonly assessed through probe-dependent signatures such as spectral statistics, OTOCs, and entanglement growth, which need not coincide. Recently, a dissipative diagnostic of chaos has been proposed, in which an infinitesimal coupling to a bath yields a finite Liouvillian gap in chaotic systems, marking the onset of intrinsic relaxation. This raises a conceptual question: what is the minimal departure from Clifford dynamics needed for this intrinsically relaxing behavior to emerge? In this work, we investigate the dynamics under the Floquet two-qubit Clifford circuit…
