Highly multipartite entangled states play an important role in various quantum computing tasks. We investigate the dissipative generation of a complex entanglement structure as in a cluster state through engineered Markovian dynamics in the spin systems coupled via Ising interactions. Using the Lindblad master equation, we design a projection based dissipative channel that drives the system toward a unique pure steady state corresponding to the desired cluster state. This is done by removing the contribution of the orthogonal states. By explicitly constructing the Liouvillian superoperator in…

We investigate the effective potential and the string tension for the spatial Wilson loop (SWL) in hot dense QGP with two types of anisotropy, i.e. external magnetic field and spatial anisotropy, employing a holographic approach for the heavy quark model. In this approach, the string is extended in the 5th, holographic direction and has a turning point either on a dynamical wall (DW) configuration or on the horizon configuration in the 5th direction. We obtain the magnetic catalysis behavior for a phase transition between DW and horizon configuration of the string. The structure of the phase…

We introduce the genuine multipartite Rains entanglement (GMRE) as a measure of genuine multipartite entanglement that can be computed using semi-definite programming. Similar to the Rains relative entropy (its bipartite counterpart), the GMRE is monotone under selective quantum operations that completely preserve the positivity of the partial transpose, implying that it is a multipartite entanglement monotone. As a consequence, we show that the GMRE bounds both the one-shot standard and probabilistic approximate GHZ-distillable entanglement from above. We also develop a generalization of…

This book gives a geometry-first, hardware-aware route through quantum-information workflows, with one goal: connect states, circuits, and measurement to deterministic classical pipelines that make hybrid quantum systems run. Part 1 develops the backbone (essential linear algebra, the Bloch-sphere viewpoint, differential-geometric intuition, and quantum Fisher information geometry) so evolution can be read as motion on curved spaces and measurement as statistics. Part 2 reframes circuits as dataflow graphs: measurement outcomes are parsed, aggregated, and reduced to small linear-algebra…

## 5. Network-Based Quantum Computing: an efficient design framework for many-small-node distributed fault-tolerant quantum computing

In fault-tolerant quantum computing, a large number of physical qubits are required to construct a single logical qubit, and a single quantum node may be able to hold only a small number of logical qubits. In such a case, the idea of distributed fault-tolerant quantum computing (DFTQC) is important to demonstrate large-scale quantum computation using small-scale nodes. However, the design of distributed systems on small-scale nodes, where each node can store only one or a few logical qubits for computation, has not been explored well yet. In this paper, we propose network-based quantum…

One of the key considerations in the development of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) protocols is the encoding of classical data onto a quantum device. In this chapter we introduce the Matrix Product State representation of quantum systems and show how it may be used to construct circuits which encode a desired state. Putting this in the context of QML we show how this process may be modified to give a low depth approximate encoding and crucially that this encoding does not hinder classification accuracy and is indeed exhibits an increased robustness against classical adversarial attacks. This…

Compared to other stable isotopes of $\rm{Yb}^+$, $^{173}\rm{Yb}^+$ has a richer hyperfine structure, which leads to more favorable clock transitions, spectroscopic techniques for probing new physics, and more sophisticated quantum computing architectures. However, to date, its electronic spectrum remains poorly characterized. Here, we report on efficient laser cooling, state preparation, and detection of a single trapped $^{173}\rm{Yb}^+$ ion. The previously unobserved $^2\!S_{1/2} \rightarrow {}^2\!D_{3/2}$ electric quadrupole transition at 436 nm is coherently excited, and the isotope…

We investigate the quantum properties of heavy-fermion pairs, such as $t\bar t$ or $τ^+τ^-$, produced in lepton-lepton collisions with polarised beams. Focusing on spin correlations, entanglement, Bell-inequality violation, and quantum-information--theoretic measures such as purity and magic, we analyse how beam polarisation shapes the structure of the spin-density matrix. We derive analytic expressions for a wide range of helicity configurations, including both Standard Model contributions and generic new-physics effects parametrised by scalar, vector, and tensor four-fermion operators…

## 9. A measurement-based protocol for the generation of delocalised quantum states of a mechanical system

Non-Gaussian mechanical states are a key resource for quantum-enhanced sensing and tests of macroscopic quantum physics. We propose a measurement-based protocol to herald delocalized, nonclassical states of a mechanical oscillator in cavity optomechanics by conditioning on Geiger photodetection of the optical output. We analyse under which conditions Stokes-induced optomechanical entanglement give rise to mechanical Wigner Function negativity upon detection. We develop and compare a blue-detuned pulsed scheme and a continuous-wave steady-state scheme employing temporal-mode filtering, and we…

The preparation of quantum states is one of the most fundamental tasks in quantum computing, and a key primitive in many quantum algorithms. Of particular interest to areas such as quantum simulation and linear-system solvers are sparse quantum states, which contain only a small number $s$ of non-zero computational basis states compared to a generic state. In this work, we present an approach that prepares $s$-sparse states on $n$ qubits, reducing the number of Toffoli gates required compared to prior art. We work in the established framework of first preparing a dense state on a…

The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis explains thermalization in isolated quantum systems through the statistical properties of observables in the energy eigenbasis. We investigate the crossover from integrability to chaos in the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain, establishing a direct correspondence between the spectral correlations of the Hamiltonian and local observables expressed in the energy eigenbasis as a signature of ergodicity breaking. By introducing a local perturbation that drives the system from integrability to chaos, we track the standard ETH indicators and the eigenstate entanglement…
