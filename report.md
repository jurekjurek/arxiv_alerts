We attempt the use of a unitary operator to approximate the lattice Boltzmann collision operator. We use a modified amplitude encoding to bypass the renormalization that would have required classical processing at every step (thus eroding any quantum advantage to be had). We describe the hard-wiring of the lattice Boltzmann symmetries into the quantum circuit and show that, for the specific case of the cavity flow, approximating the nonlinear system is limited to low velocities. These findings may help us understand better the possibilities of nonlinear simulations on a quantum computer, and…

We present a hybrid quantum-classical framework augmented with learned error mitigation for solving the viscous Burgers equation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Using the Cole-Hopf transformation, the nonlinear Burgers equation is mapped to a diffusion equation, discretized on uniform grids, and encoded into a quantum state whose time evolution is approximated via Trotterized nearest-neighbor circuits implemented in Qiskit. Quantum simulations are executed on noisy Aer backends and IBM superconducting quantum devices and are benchmarked against high-accuracy classical…

We construct holonomic quantum gates for qubits that are encoded in the near-degenerate vibrational $E$-doublet of a deformable three-body system. Using Kendall's shape theory, we derive the Wilczek--Zee connection governing adiabatic transport within the $E$-manifold. We show that its restricted holonomy group is $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, implying universal single-qubit control by closed loops in shape space. We provide explicit loops implementing a $π/2$ phase gate and a Hadamard-type gate. For two-qubit operations, we outline how linked holonomic cycles in arrays generate a controlled…

## 4. Quantum Visual Word Sense Disambiguation: Unraveling Ambiguities Through Quantum Inference Model

Visual word sense disambiguation focuses on polysemous words, where candidate images can be easily confused. Traditional methods use classical probability to calculate the likelihood of an image matching each gloss of the target word, summing these to form a posterior probability. However, due to the challenge of semantic uncertainty, glosses from different sources inevitably carry semantic biases, which can lead to biased disambiguation results. Inspired by quantum superposition in modeling uncertainty, this paper proposes a Quantum Inference Model for Unsupervised Visual Word Sense…

Quantum neural networks (QNNs) suffer from severe gate-level redundancy, which hinders their deployment on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we propose q-iPrune, a one-shot structured pruning framework grounded in the algebraic structure of $q$-deformed groups and task-conditioned quantum geometry. Unlike prior heuristic or gradient-based pruning methods, q-iPrune formulates redundancy directly at the gate level. Each gate is compared within an algebraically consistent subgroup using a task-conditioned $q$-overlap distance, which measures functional similarity…
