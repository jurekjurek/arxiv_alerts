Entanglement swapping between photon pairs generated at physically separated nodes over telecommunication fiber infrastructure is an essential step towards the quantum internet, enabling applications such as quantum repeaters, blind quantum computing, distributed quantum computing, and distributed quantum sensing. However, successful networked entanglement swapping relies on generating indistinguishable pairs of photons and preserving them over deployed fibers. This has limited most previous demonstrations to laboratory settings or relied on sophisticated methods to maintain the necessary…

In this paper, we provide a complete mathematical theory for the entanglement of mixtures of Dicke states. These quantum states form an important subclass of bosonic states arising in the study of indistinguishable particles. We introduce a tensor-based parametrization where the diagonal entries of these states are encoded as a symmetric tensor, enabling a direct translation between entanglement properties and well-studied convex cones of tensors. Our results bridge multipartite entanglement theory with semialgebraic geometry and the theory of completely positive and copositive tensors. This…

## 3. Optimal Classification of Three-Qubit Entanglement with Cascaded Support Vector Machine

We introduce a systematic framework for three-qubit entanglement classification using a cascaded architecture of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. Leveraging the well defined three-qubit structure with the four nested entanglement classes (S, B, W, and GHZ), we construct three distinct witness models ($\mathcal{M}_{B}$, $\mathcal{M}_{W}$, and $\mathcal{M}_{GHZ}$) that sequentially discriminate between these classes. The proposed Cascaded model achieves an overall classification accuracy of $95\%$ on a comprehensive dataset of mixed states. The framework's robustness and generalization…

Quantum correlations, crucial for the advantage and advancement of quantum science and technology, arise from the impossibility of expressing a quantum state as a tensor product over a given set of parties. In this work, a generalized notion of correlations via arbitrary products is formulated. Remarkably, as a universal property, the connection between such general products and tensor products is established, allowing one to relate generic non-product states to the common notion of entangled states. We construct the set of free operations for general types of products by extending the…

We study the task of quantum state exclusion, focusing on antidistinguishability and its generalization to $x$-antidistinguishability, under global measurements and local operations with classical communication (LOCC). We also introduce weak and strong notions of antidistinguiahbaility ($x$-antidistinguishability) depending on whether all states or all $x$-tuples are exhaustively eliminated. Our results reveal striking differences between state exclusion and the more familiar task of state discrimination. In particular, we show that LOCC antidistinguishability of multipartite product states…

Energy consumption is becoming a serious bottleneck for integrating quantum technologies within the existing global information infrastructure. In photonic architectures, considerable energy overheads stem from using lasers, whose high coherence was long considered indispensable for quantum state preparation. Here, we demonstrate that natural, incoherent sunlight can successfully produce quantum-entangled states via spontaneous parametric down-conversion. We detect polarization-entangled photon pairs with a concurrence of $0.905\pm0.053$ and a Bell state fidelity of $0.939\pm0.027$.…

We explore the industrial and scientific applicability of the VQE-LSTM framework by integrating meta-learning with GPU accelerated quantum simulation using NVIDIA's CUDA-Q (CUDAQ) platform. This work demonstrates how an LSTM-FC meta-initialization module can extend the practical reach of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) in both chemistry and physics domains. In the chemical regime, the framework predicts ground-state energies of molecular Hamiltonians derived from PySCF, achieving near FCI accuracy while maintaining favorable O(N^2) scaling with molecular size. In the physical…

The recent demonstrations of cascaded PDC (CPDC) and the hopeful prospects of realizing third-order PDC (TOPDC) for the generation of three-photon entangled states are paving the way for experimental studies on genuine three-photon interference. In this article, we formulate three-photon interference in terms of ``each three-photon interfering only with itself.'' We show that although a generalized two-alternative three-photon interference setup based on CPDC or TOPDC involves eight different length parameters, the interference can be fully characterized in terms of only three independent…
