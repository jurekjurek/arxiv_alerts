We present a systematic investigation of deep learning methods applied to quantum error mitigation of noisy output probability distributions from measured quantum circuits. We compare different architectures, from fully connected neural networks to transformers, and we test different design/training modalities, identifying sequence-to-sequence, attention-based models as the most effective on our datasets. These models consistently produce mitigated distributions that are closer to the ideal outputs when tested on both simulated and real device data obtained from IBM superconducting quantum…

We identify localizable entanglement (LE) as an order parameter for measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT). LE exhibits universal finite-size scaling with critical exponents that match previous MIPT results and gives a nice operational interpretation connecting MIPTs to classical percolation. Remarkably, we find that LE decays exponentially with distance in the area-law phase as opposed to being essentially constant for the volume-law phase thereby, discover an intrinsic length scale $ξ_E$ that diverges at the critical measurement probability $p_c$. While classical percolation…

Understanding the entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems under steady-state transport conditions is an actively pursued challenging topic. Hydrodynamic equations, akin to transport equations for charge or heat, would be of great interest but face severe challenges because of the inherent nonlocality of entanglement and the difficulty of identifying conservation laws. We show that progress is facilitated by using information as key quantity related to - but distinct from - entanglement. Employing the recently developed "information lattice" framework, we characterize spatially and…

In the Wigner-Weyl phase space formulation of quantum mechanics, we analyse the problem of the spreading of an initial state or an initial operator under time evolution when described in terms of the Krylov basis. After constructing the phase space representations of the Krylov basis states generated by a Hamiltonian from a given initial state by using the Weyl transformation, we subsequently use them to cast the Krylov state complexity as an integral over the phase space in terms of the Wigner function of the time-evolved initial state, so that the contribution of the classical Liouville…

## 5. Composing $p$-adic qubits: from representations of SO(3)$_p$ to entanglement and universal quantum logic gates

In the context of $p$-adic quantum mechanics, we investigate composite systems of $p$-adic qubits and $p$-adically controlled quantum logic gates. We build on the notion of a single $p$-adic qubit as a two-dimensional irreducible representation of the compact $p$-adic special orthogonal group SO(3)$_p$. We show that the classification of these representations reduces to the finite case, as they all factorise through some finite quotient SO(3)$_p$ mod $p^k$. Then, we tackle the problem of $p$-adic qubit composition and entanglement, fundamental for a $p$-adic formulation of quantum information…

We formulate pure-state entanglement in families as a geometric obstruction. In standard quantum information, entanglement is defined relative to a chosen tensor-product factorization of a fixed Hilbert space. In contrast, for a twisted family of pure-state spaces, which can be described by Azumaya algebras $A$ of degree $n$ on $X$ and their Severi-Brauer schemes \[ SB(A)=P\times^{PGL_n}\mathbb{P}^{n-1}\to X, \] such a subsystem choice may fail to globalize. We formalize this algebro-geometrically: fixing a factorization type $\mathbf d=(d_1,\dots,d_s)$ with $n=\prod_i d_i$, the existence of…

Although quantum computing holds promise for solving Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs), the limited qubit capacity of NISQ hardware makes large-scale instances intractable. Conventional methods attempt to bridge this gap through decomposition or compression, yet they frequently fail to capture global correlations of subsystems, leading to solutions of limited quality. We propose the Distributed Variational Quantum Algorithm (DVQA) to overcome these limitations, enabling the solution of 1,000-variable instances on constrained hardware. A key innovation of DVQA is its use of the…

Quantum many-body scars are non-thermal eigenstates embedded in the spectra of otherwise non-integrable Hamiltonians. Paradigmatic examples often appear as quasiparticle towers of states, such as the maximally ferromagnetic spin-1/2 states, also known as Dicke states. A distinguishing feature of quantum many-body scars is that they admit multiple local "parent" Hamiltonians for which they are exact eigenstates. In this work, we show that the locality of such parent Hamiltonians strongly constrains the relative placement of these states within the energy spectrum. In particular, we prove that…

The Hong-Ou-Mandel test estimates the overlap between spectral functions characterizing the internal degrees of freedom of two single photons. It can be viewed as a photon-native protocol that implements the well-known quantum SWAP test. Here, we propose a native linear-optical protocol that efficiently estimates multivariate traces of quantum states called Bargmann invariants, which are ubiquitous in quantum mechanics. Our protocol may be understood as a photon-native version of the cycle test in the circuit model, which encompasses many-photon multimode quantum states. We show the protocol…

Quantum memories are key components of emerging quantum technologies. They are designed to store quantum states and retrieve them on demand without losing features such as superposition and entanglement. Verifying that a memory preserves these features is indispensable for applications such as quantum computation, cryptography and networks, yet no general and assumption-free method has been available. Here, we present a device-independent approach for certifying black-box quantum memories, requiring no trust in any part of the experimental setup. We do so by probing quantum systems at two…

Generalized contextuality is a possible indicator of non-classical behaviour in quantum information theory. In finite-dimensional systems, this is justified by the fact that noncontextual theories can be embedded into some simplex, i.e. into a classical theory. We show that a direct application of the standard definition of generalized contextuality to continuous variable systems does not envelope the statistics of some basic measurements, such as the position observable. In other words, we construct families of fully classical, i.e. commuting, measurements that nevertheless can be used to…

Mixed-integer linear programming problems are extensively used in industry for a wide range of optimization tasks. However, as they get larger, they present computational challenges for classical solvers within practical time limits. Quantum annealers can, in principle, accelerate the solution of problems formulated as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization instances, but their limited scale currently prevents achieving practical speedups. Quantum-classical algorithms have been proposed to take advantage of both paradigms and to allow current quantum computers to be used in larger…

Protecting speaker identity is crucial for online voice applications, yet streaming speaker anonymization (SA) remains underexplored. Recent research has demonstrated that neural audio codec (NAC) provides superior speaker feature disentanglement and linguistic fidelity. NAC can also be used with causal language models (LM) to enhance linguistic fidelity and prompt control for streaming tasks. However, existing NAC-based online LM systems are designed for voice conversion (VC) rather than anonymization, lacking the techniques required for privacy protection. Building on these advances, we…

We present a method for performing a full graph expansion for light-matter systems, utilizing the linked-cluster theorem. This method enables us to explore $1/N$ corrections to the thermodynamic limit $N\to \infty$ in the number of particles, giving us access to the mesoscopic regime. While this regime is yet largely unexplored due to the challenges of studying it with established approaches, it incorporates intriguing features, such as entanglement between light and matter that vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. As a representative application, we calculate physical quantities of the…

On-chip generation of high-purity single photons is essential for scalable photonic quantum technologies. Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is widely used to generate photon pairs for heralded single-photon sources, but intrinsic spectral correlations of the pairs often limit the purity and interference visibility of the heralded photons. Existing approaches to suppress these correlations rely on narrowband spectral filtering, which introduces loss, or exploiting different polarizations, which complicates on-chip integration. Here, we demonstrate a new strategy for generating…

We introduce a physics-informed Generative Adversarial Network framework that recasts quantum resource-state generation as an inverse-design task. By embedding task-specific utility functions into training, the model learns to generate valid two-qubit states optimized for teleportation and entanglement broadcasting. Comparing decomposition-based and direct-generation architectures reveals that structural enforcement of Hermiticity, trace-one, and positivity yields higher fidelity and training stability than loss-only approaches. The framework reproduces theoretical resource boundaries for…

Quantum entanglement offers an incredible resource for enhancing the sensing and spectroscopic probes. Here we develop a microscopic theory for the stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) using entangled photons. We demonstrate that the time-energy correlation of the photon pairs can optimize the signal for polyatomic molecules. Our results show that the spectral-line intensity of the entangled-photon SRS (ESRS) is of the same order of magnitude as the one for the entangled two-photon absorption (ETPA); the parameter window is thus identified to do so. Moreover, the vibrational coherence is found…
