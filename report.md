## 1. High-Probability Heralded Entanglement via Repeated Spin-Photon Phase Encoding with Moderate Cooperativity

We propose a heralded high-probability scheme to generate remote entanglement between moderate-cooperativity spin-cavity registers with high fidelity. In conventional single-shot interfaces, limited cooperativity restricts the spin-conditional optical response and thus strongly suppresses the success probability. Our proposal instead recycles a single incident photon for repeated interactions with the spin-cavity register, such that a small spin-conditional phase shift acquired on each round trip accumulates coherently to enable remote entanglement. Moreover, the repeated scheme enables…

Dysarthric speech exhibits high variability and limited labeled data, posing major challenges for both automatic speech recognition (ASR) and assistive speech technologies. Existing approaches rely on synthetic data augmentation or speech reconstruction, yet often entangle speaker identity with pathological articulation, limiting controllability and robustness. In this paper, we propose ProtoDisent-TTS, a prototype-based disentanglement TTS framework built on a pre-trained text-to-speech backbone that factorizes speaker timbre and dysarthric articulation within a unified latent space. A…

Quantum networks, integrating quantum communication, quantum metrology, and distributed quantum computing, could provide secure and efficient information transfer, high-resolution sensing, and an exponential speed-up in information processing. Deterministic entanglement distribution over long distances is a prerequisite for scalable quantum networks, enabling the utilization of device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) and quantum teleportation to achieve secure and efficient information transfer. However, the exponential photon loss in optical fibres prohibits efficient and…

We propose a sensing scheme for detecting weak forces that achieves Heisenberg-limited sensitivity without relying on entanglement or other non-classical resources. Our scheme utilizes coherent averaging across a chain of N optomechanical cavities, unidirectionally coupled via a laser beam. As the beam passes through the cavities, it accumulates phase shifts induced by a common external force acting on the mechanical elements. Remarkably, this fully classical approach achieves the sensitivity scaling typically associated with quantum-enhanced protocols, providing a robust and experimentally…

Using polarization entangled photon pairs, we demonstrate a robust scheme for quantum illumination and ranging in a lossy environment. Entangled photon pairs are generated in a Sagnac interferometer configuration, yielding high-visibility two-photon polarization entanglement with a measured CHSH parameter of $S =2.802\pm0.002$. One of the photons from the entangled pair is retained as idler and the other one is directed into either of the two paths, namely reference and probe, of which probe is sent toward a distant object through a lossy free-space channel, and the reflected photons are…

A fully fibered source of entangled photon pairs based on a nonlinear Sagnac interferometer is reported. Operating at telecom wavelengths, the source relies exclusively on standard fiber-optic components and periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguides, resulting in a compact, robust, and field-deployable architecture. The generation stage supports both polarization and energy-time entanglement without modification, enabling versatile operation depending on the targeted application. Broadband spontaneous parametric down-conversion allows dense wavelength-division multiplexing over the…

Non-Hermiticity plays a fundamental role in open quantum systems and describes a wide variety of effects of interactions with environments, including quantum measurement. However, understanding its consequences in strongly interacting systems is still elusive due to the interplay between non-perturbative strong correlations and non-Hermiticity. While the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) method has been applied to tackle this problem, its foundation, based on the existence of the partition function, is ill-defined. In this paper, we establish a microscopic foundation of the non-Hermitian…

Designing scalable, noise-tolerant control protocols for multipartite entanglement is a central challenge for quantum technologies, and it naturally calls for \emph{algorithmic} synthesis of interaction parameters rather than handcrafted gate sequences. Here we introduce an intelligent, constraint-aware control framework for deterministic generation of symmetric Dicke states $|D_n^{(m)}\rangle$ in repeated-interaction (collision-model) architectures. The protocol employs excitation-preserving partial-SWAP collisions between two disjoint qubit registers, mediated by $m$ ancillary ``shuttle''…

Variational quantum algorithms have gained attention as early applications of quantum computers for learning tasks. In the context of supervised learning, most of the works that tackle classification problems with parameterized quantum circuits constrain their scope to the setting of binary classification or perform multiclass classification via ensembles of binary classifiers (strategies such as one versus rest). Those few works that propose native multiclass models, however, do not justify the choice of observables that perform the classification. This work studies two main classification…

Noise forms a central obstacle to effective quantum information processing. Recent experimental advances have enabled the tailoring of noise properties through Pauli twirling, transforming arbitrary noise channels into Pauli channels. This underpins theoretical descriptions of fault-tolerant quantum computation and forms an essential tool in noise characterization and error mitigation. Pauli-Lindblad channels have been introduced to aptly parameterize quasi-local Pauli errors across a quantum register, excluding negative Pauli-Lindblad parameters relying on the Markovianity of the underlying…

Using a finite geometric framework for studying the pentagon and heptagon codes we show that the concepts of quantum secret sharing and contextuality can be studied in a nice and unified manner. The basic idea is a careful study of the respective $2+3$ and $3+4$ tensorial factorizations of the elements of the stabilizer groups of these codes. It is demonstrated in detail how finite geometric structures entailing a specific three-qubit (resp. four-qubit) embedding of binary symplectic polar spaces of rank two (resp. three), corresponding to these factorizations, govern issues of contextuality…

It is crucial to design quantum circuits as small as possible and as shallow as possible for quantum information processing tasks. We design quantum circuits with simplified gate-count, cost, and depth for implementing quantum teleportation among various entangled channels. Here the gate-count/cost/depth of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-based quantum teleportation is reduced from 10/6/8 to 9/4/6, the two-qubit-cluster-based quantum teleportation is reduced from 9/4/5 to 6/3/5, the three-qubit-cluster-based quantum teleportation is reduced from 12/6/7 to 8/4/5, the Brown-based quantum…
