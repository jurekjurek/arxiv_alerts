We study the entanglement negativity for the free, scalar chiral current in two spacetime dimensions, which is a simple model violating the Haag duality in regions with nontrivial topology. For the ground state of the system, both on the line and on the circle, we consider the setups given by two intervals, either adjacent or disjoint. We find analytic expressions for the moments of the partial transpose of the reduced density matrix and the logarithmic negativity. In the limit of small separation distance, this expression yields the same subleading topological contribution occurring in the…

Quantum coherence and entanglement are fundamental resources in quantum technologies, yet their efficient estimation for unknown states by employing minimal resources in experimental settings remains challenging, particularly in high-dimensional systems. We present a machine learning approach based on support vector regression (SVR) that directly estimates the coherence measures and the geometric measure of quantum entanglement using minimal experimental resources. Our method requires only the diagonal entries of the density matrix, along with the traces of the squared and cubed density…

One of the core research questions in the theory of quantum computing is to find out to what precise extent the classical simulation of a noisy quantum circuits is possible and where potential quantum advantages can set in. In this work, we introduce a unified framework for the classical simulation of quantum circuits based on frame theory, encompassing and generalizing a broad class of existing simulation strategies. Within this framework, the computational cost of a simulation algorithm is determined by the one-norm of an associated quasi-probability distribution, providing a common…

In fault-tolerant quantum computation, the preparation of logical states is a ubiquitous subroutine, yet significant challenges persist even for the simplest states required. In the present work, we present a unitary, scalable, distance-preserving encoding scheme for preparing Pauli eigenstates in surface codes. Unlike previous unitary approaches whose fault-distance remains constant with increasing code distance, our scheme ensures that the protection offered by the code is preserved during state preparation. Building on strategies discovered by reinforcement learning for the surface-17…

Quantum networks connecting quantum processing nodes via photonic links enable distributed and modular quantum computation. In this framework, quantum gates between remote qubits can be realized using quantum teleportation protocols. The essential requirements for such non-local gates are remote entanglement, local quantum logic within each processor, and classical communication between nodes to perform operations based on measurement outcomes. Here, we demonstrate an unconditional Controlled-NOT quantum gate between remote diamond-based qubit devices. The control and target qubits are…

Quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising application domain for near-term quantum hardware, particularly through hybrid quantum-classical models that leverage both classical and quantum processing. Although numerous hybrid architectures have been proposed and demonstrated successfully on benchmark tasks, a significant open question remains regarding the specific contribution of quantum components to the overall performance of these models. In this work, we aim to shed light on the impact of quantum processing within hybrid quantum-classical neural network architectures through a…

We explore the limitations of using imbalance dynamics as a diagnostic tool for many-body localization (MBL) and show that spatial averaging can mask important microscopic features. Focusing on the strongly disordered regime of the random-field XXZ chain, we use state-of-the-art numerical techniques (Krylov time evolution and full diagonalization) to demonstrate that site-resolved spin autocorrelators reveal a rich and complex dynamical behavior that is obscured by the imbalance observable. By analyzing the time evolution and infinite-time limits of these local probes, we reveal resonant…

## 8. Hardy nonlocality for entangled pairs in a four-particle system

Nonlocality can be studied through different approaches, such as Bell's inequalities, and it can be found in numerous quantum states, including GHZ states or graph states. Hardy's paradox, or Hardy-type nonlocality, provides a way to investigate nonlocality for entangled states of particles without using inequalities. Previous studies of Hardy's nonlocality have mostly focused on the fully entangled systems, while other entanglement configurations remain less explored. In this work, the system under investigation consists of four particles arranged in a cyclic entanglement configuration,…
