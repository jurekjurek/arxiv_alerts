We investigate the long-distance behavior of dyonic loop operators in 4d $SU(N)$ gauge theories on $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1$ using the 3d monopole semiclassics. If we employ the naive definition of the 't Hooft loop in the Abelianized regime, the dyonic loop operators do not admit the well-defined computations within the effective field theory. Moreover, if one forcibly proceeds with the computations of their expectation values, all the dyonic loops turn out to show the area law, which contradicts the prediction of the Wilson-'t Hooft classification. In this paper, we resolve this puzzle by…

We propose and experimentally demonstrate a global parametric gate that generates multi-qubit entangled states in a single step. By applying a parametric drive to a common qubit at precise detunings relative to computational qubits, we directly produce two-, three-, and four-qubit entanglement with state fidelities of 99.4\%\pm0.2\%, 93.4\%\pm0.3\%, and 91.4\%\pm0.3\%, respectively. This scheme enables efficient, reconfigurable control using only microwave drives and is compatible with fixed-frequency qubits. Error analyses indicate that infidelity stems primarily from decoherence and…

Understanding real-time dynamics of interacting quantum fields in curved spacetime remains a major theoretical challenge. We employ tensor network methods to study such dynamics using interacting scalar and gauge theories in 1+1 spacetime dimensions, subject to a quench modeling a homogeneously expanding gravitational background. The models considered are the scalar $λφ^4$ theory and the Schwinger model, i.e. a Dirac fermion coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field which is equivalent via bosonization to a scalar field with a cosine self-interaction. In the free scalar limit, both theories reproduce…

Bell inequality tests based on high-dimensional entanglement usually require measurements that can resolve multiple possible outcomes. However, the implementation of high-dimensional multi-outcome measurements is often only emulated via a collection of ``click or no-click'' measurements. This reduction of multi-outcome measurements to binary-outcome measurements opens a loophole in high-dimensional tests Bell inequalities which can be exploited by local hidden variable models [Tavakoli et al., Phys. Rev. A 111, 042433 (2025)]. Here, we close this loophole by using four-dimensional photonic…

## 5. A General Class of Functionals for Certifying Quantum Incompatibility

Quantum steering, measurement incompatibility, and instrument incompatibility have recently been recognized as unified manifestations of quantum incompatibility. Building on this perspective, we develop a general framework for constructing optimization-free, nonlinear incompatibility witnesses based on convex functionals, valid in arbitrary dimensions. We prove that these witnesses are nontrivial precisely when the underlying functional is non-affine on extremal points (e.g., pure states for ensembles). For pure bipartite states, the witnesses yield lower bounds on entanglement measures,…

Quantum computers are inherently noisy, and a crucial challenge for achieving large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computing is to implement quantum error correction. A promising direction that has made rapid recent progress is to design hardware that has a specific noise profile, leading to a significantly higher threshold for noise with certain quantum error correcting codes. This Perspective focuses on erasure qubits, which enable hardware-efficient quantum error correction, by concatenating an inner code built-in to the hardware with an outer code. We focus on implementations of dual-rail…

Quantum machine learning (QML) is expected to offer new opportunities to process high-dimensional data efficiently by exploiting the exponentially large state space of quantum systems. In this work, we apply quantum extreme reservoir computing (QERC) to the classification of microstructure images of polymer alloys generated using self-consistent field theory (SCFT). While previous QML efforts have primarily focused on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, our work demonstrates the applicability of QERC to engineering data with direct materials relevance. Through numerical experiments, we examine…

Compilers transform code into action. They convert high-level programs into executable hardware instructions - a crucial step in enabling reliable and scalable quantum computation. However, quantum compilation is still in its infancy, and many existing solutions are ad hoc, often developed independently and from scratch. The resulting lack of interoperability leads to significant missed potential, as quantum software tools remain isolated and cannot be seamlessly integrated into cohesive toolchains. The Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) has addressed analogous challenges in the…

The foundational work by Bell led to an interest in understanding non-local correlations that arise from entangled states shared between distinct, spacelike-separated parties, which formed a foundation for the theory of quantum information processing. We investigate the question of maximal correlations analogous to the maximally entangled states defined in the entanglement theory of multipartite systems. To formalize this, we employ the sheaf-theoretic framework for contextuality, which generalizes non-locality. This provides a new metric for correlations called contextual fraction (CF),…

Bargmann invariants, a class of gauge-invariant quantities arising from the overlaps of quantum state vectors, provide a profound and unifying framework for understanding the geometric structure of quantum mechanics. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of Bargmann invariants, with a particular focus on their role in shaping the informational geometry of the state space. The core of this review demonstrates how these invariants serve as a powerful tool for characterizing the intrinsic geometry of the space of quantum states, leading to applications in determining local unitary…

Photon-induced Near-field Electron Microscopy (PINEM) effect has revealed the quantum interaction between free electrons and optical near filed, which demonstrated plenty of novel phenomena of manipulating free electron wave packet and detecting/shaping quantum photonic states. However, free electrons generally only absorb/emit one photon at a time, while the physical mechanism and phenomena of free electron-two-photon interaction have not been studied yet. Moreover, the relationship between PINEM and Kapitza-Dirac (KD) effect and nonlinear Compton scattering is still unclear. Here we develop…
