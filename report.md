This paper presents a feasibility study demonstrating that quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms achieve competitive performance on real-world medical imaging despite operating under severe constraints. We evaluate Equilibrium Propagation (EP), an energy-based learning method that does not use backpropagation (incompatible with quantum systems due to state-collapsing measurements) and Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) for automated detection of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) from blood cell microscopy images using binary classification (2 classes: AML vs. Healthy). Key Result: Using…

Determining the ground and low-lying excited states is critical in numerous scenarios. Recent work has proposed the ancilla-entangled variational quantum eigensolver (AEVQE) that utilizes entanglement between ancilla and physical qubits to simultaneously tagert multiple low-lying energy levels. In this work, we report the experimental implementation of the AEVQE on a superconducting quantum cloud platform, demonstrating the full procedure of solving the low-lying energy levels of the H$_2$ molecule and the transverse-field Ising models (TFIMs). We obtain the potential energy curves of H$_2$…

Accurately simulating long-time dynamics of many-body systems is a challenge in both classical and quantum computing due to the accumulation of Trotter errors. While low-order Trotter-Suzuki decompositions are straightforward to implement, their rapidly growing error limits access to long-time observables. We present a framework for constructing efficient high-order Trotter-Suzuki schemes by identifying their structure and directly optimizing their parameters over a high-dimensional space. This method enables the discovery of new schemes with significantly improved efficiency compared to…

Quantum computing requires the optimization of control pulses to achieve high-fidelity quantum gates. We propose a machine learning-based protocol to address the challenges of evaluating gradients and modeling complex system dynamics. By training a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict qubit behavior, our approach enables efficient gradient-based pulse optimization without the need for a detailed system model. First, we sample qubit dynamics using random control pulses with weak prior assumptions. We then train the RNN on the system's observed responses, and use the trained model to…

Assessing whether a noisy quantum device can potentially exhibit quantum advantage is essential for selecting practical quantum utility tasks that are not efficiently verifiable by classical means. For optimization, a prominent candidate for quantum advantage, entropy benchmarking provides insights based concomitantly on the specifics of the application and its implementation, as well as hardware noise. However, such an approach still does not account for finite-shot effects or for quantum error mitigation (QEM), a key near-term error suppression strategy that reduces estimation bias at the…

Generating quantum data by learning the underlying quantum distribution poses challenges in both theoretical and practical scenarios, yet it is a critical task for understanding quantum systems. A fundamental question in quantum machine learning (QML) is the universality of approximation: whether a parameterized QML model can approximate any quantum distribution. We address this question by proving a universality theorem for the Many-body Projected Ensemble (MPE) framework, a method for quantum state design that uses a single many-body wave function to prepare random states. This demonstrates…

The integration of high-penetration renewable energy introduces significant stochasticity and non-convexity into power system dispatching, challenging the computational limits of classical optimization. While Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices offer a promising path for combinatorial acceleration, existing approaches typically treat the power grid as a "black box", suffering from poor scalability (barren plateaus) and frequent violations of physical constraints. Bridging these gaps, this paper proposes a Physics-Informed Hybrid…

We present a general framework for applying linear quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques directly to physical qubits within a logical qubit to suppress logical errors. By exploiting the linearity of quantum error correction (QEC), we demonstrate that any linear QEM method$\unicode{x2014}$including probabilistic error cancellation (PEC), zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE), and symmetry verification$\unicode{x2014}$can be integrated into the physical layer without requiring modifications to the subsequent QEC decoder. Applying this framework to memory experiments using PEC, we analytically…

Efficient entanglement distribution is the cornerstone of the Quantum Internet. However, physical link parameters such as photon loss, memory coherence time, and gate error rates fluctuate dynamically, rendering static purification strategies suboptimal. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Purification Controller (APC) that autonomously optimizes the entanglement distillation sequence to maximize the "goodput," the rate of delivered pairs meeting a strict fidelity threshold. By treating protocol selection as a resource allocation problem, the APC dynamically switches between purification…

Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) constitutes a paradigm-shifting protocol that permits the activation of local vacuum energy through the consumption of pre-existing entanglement and classical communication. Nevertheless, the implementation of QET is severely impeded by the fundamental locality of gapped many-body systems, where the exponential clustering of ground-state correlations restricts energy extraction to microscopic scales. In this work, we address this scalability crisis within the framework of the one-dimensional anisotropic XY model. We initially provide a rigorous…
