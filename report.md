We consider the phenomenon of string breaking in the context of the spatial Wilson loops using the gauge/string duality. In particular, we discuss the impact of light flavors on the pseudopotential. We also introduce the notion of the spatial string breaking distance and estimate it for $SU(3)$ gauge theory in the temperature range $0\,\text{-}\,3\,T_c$.

We investigate universal entanglement signatures of mixed-state phases obtained by decohering pure-state topological order (TO), focusing on topological corrections to logarithmic entanglement negativity and mutual information: topological entanglement negativity (TEN) and topological mutual information (TMI). For Abelian TOs under decoherence, we develop a replica field-theory framework based on a doubled-state construction that relates TEN and TMI to the quantum dimensions of domain-wall defects between decoherence-induced topological boundary conditions, yielding general expressions in the…

Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for quantum machine learning in the NISQ era. While parameter sharing in VQCs can reduce the parameter space dimensionality and potentially mitigate the barren plateau phenomenon, it introduces a complex trade-off that has been largely overlooked. This paper investigates how parameter sharing, despite creating better global optima with fewer parameters, fundamentally alters the optimization landscape through deceptive gradients -- regions where gradient information exists but systematically misleads optimizers away from…

## 4. Enhancing delocalization and entanglement in asymmetric discrete-time quantum walks

In this paper, we investigate the enhancement of delocalization and coin-position entanglement in asymmetric discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs). The asymmetry results from asymmetric coin operations, asymmetric initial states, and asymmetric polarization-dependent losses. By varying these asymmetry factors, the inverse participation ratio and entanglement entropy of the walker are numerically calculated for different coin and loss parameters, both for symmetric and asymmetric initial states. We then experimentally implement a 16-step asymmetric DTQW using a time-multiplexing fiber loop…

## 5. Where Multipartite Entanglement Localizes: The Junction Law for Genuine Multi-Entropy

We uncover a "junction law" for genuine multipartite entanglement, suggesting that in gapped local systems multipartite entanglement is controlled and effectively localized near junctions where subsystem boundaries meet. Using the Rényi-2 genuine multi-entropy $\mathrm{GM}^{(\mathtt{q})}_2$ as a diagnostic of genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite entanglement, we establish this behavior in $(2+1)$-dimensional gapped free-fermion lattices with correlation length $ξ$. For partitions with a single junction, $\mathrm{GM}^{(\mathtt{q})}_2$ exhibits a universal scaling crossover in $L/ξ$, growing for…

Entanglement is a central and subtle feature of quantum theory, whose structure and operational behavior can change dramatically when additional physical constraints, such as symmetries or superselection rules, are imposed. Such constraints can give rise to striking and counter-intuitive phenomena, including local broadcasting of entangled states and failures of entanglement monogamy. These effects naturally arise in tomographically nonlocal theories (like real quantum theory, twirled worlds, or fermionic quantum theory), where composite systems possess holistic degrees of freedom that are…

We introduce MerLean, a fully automated agentic framework for autoformalization in quantum computation. MerLean extracts mathematical statements from \LaTeX{} source files, formalizes them into verified Lean~4 code built on Mathlib, and translates the result back into human-readable \LaTeX{} for semantic review. We evaluate MerLean on three theoretical quantum computing papers producing 2,050 Lean declarations from 114 statements in total. MerLean achieves end-to-end formalization on all three papers, reducing the verification burden to only the newly introduced definitions and axioms. Our…

We study deterministic port based teleportation in the presence of noise affecting both the entangled resource state and the measurement process. We focus on a physically motivated model in which each Bell pair constituting the resource interacts with an identical local environment, corresponding to independently distributed entangled links. Two noisy scenarios are analyzed: one with decoherence acting solely on the resource state and ideal measurements, and another with noisy, noise adapted measurements optimised for the given noise model. In the first case, we derive an analytical lower…

Encoding classical data into quantum states is a central bottleneck in quantum machine learning: many widely used encodings are circuit-inefficient, requiring deep circuits and substantial quantum resources, which limits scalability on quantum hardware. In this work, we propose TNQE, a circuit-efficient quantum data encoding framework built on structured unitary tensor network (TN) representations. TNQE first represents each classical input via a TN decomposition and then compiles the resulting tensor cores into an encoding circuit through two complementary core-to-circuit strategies. To make…
