Wilson loops are essential objects in QCD and have been pivotal in scale setting and demonstrating confinement. Various generalizations are crucial for computations needed in effective field theories. In lattice gauge theory, Wilson loop calculations face challenges, including excited-state contamination at short times and the signal-to-noise ratio issue at longer times. To address these problems, we develop a new method by using neural networks to parametrize interpolators for the static quark-antiquark pair. We construct gauge-equivariant layers for the network and train it to find the…

Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is becoming increasingly prevalent due to its potential to enhance classical machine learning (ML) tasks, such as classification. Although quantum noise is often viewed as a major challenge in quantum computing, it also offers a unique opportunity to enhance privacy. In particular, intrinsic quantum noise provides a natural stochastic resource that, when rigorously analyzed within the differential privacy (DP) framework and composed with classical mechanisms, can satisfy formal $(\varepsilon, δ)$-DP guarantees. This enables a reduction in the required classical…

Digital quantum computing promises to offer computational capabilities beyond the reach of classical systems, yet its capabilities are often challenged by scarce quantum resources. A critical bottleneck in this context is how to load classical or quantum data into quantum circuits efficiently. Approximate quantum loaders (AQLs) provide a viable solution to this problem by balancing fidelity and circuit complexity. However, most existing AQL methods are either heuristic or provide guarantees only for specific input types, and a general theoretical framework is still lacking. To address this…

Quantum simulations of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) require a representation of gauge fields and fermions on the finitely many degrees of freedom available on a quantum computer. We introduce a truncation of lattice QCD coupled to staggered fermions that includes (i) a local Krylov truncation that generates allowed basis states; (ii) a maximum allowed electric energy per link; (iii) a limit on the number of fermions per site; and (iv) a truncation in the large N_c scaling of Hamiltonian matrix elements. Explicit truncated Hamiltonians for 1+1D and 2+1D lattices are given, and numerical…

## 5. VQ-Style: Disentangling Style and Content in Motion with Residual Quantized Representations

Human motion data is inherently rich and complex, containing both semantic content and subtle stylistic features that are challenging to model. We propose a novel method for effective disentanglement of the style and content in human motion data to facilitate style transfer. Our approach is guided by the insight that content corresponds to coarse motion attributes while style captures the finer, expressive details. To model this hierarchy, we employ Residual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (RVQ-VAEs) to learn a coarse-to-fine representation of motion. We further enhance the…

Sampling a quantum systems underlying probability distributions is an important computational task, e.g., for quantum advantage experiments and quantum Monte Carlo algorithms. Tensor networks are an invaluable tool for efficiently representing states of large quantum systems with limited entanglement. Algorithms for sampling one-dimensional (1D) tensor networks are well-established and utilized in several 1D tensor network methods. In this paper we introduce two novel sampling algorithms for two-dimensional (2D) isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) that can be viewed as extensions of…

## 7. Towards Ultimate Accuracy in Quantum Multi-Class Classification: A Trace-Distance Binary Tree AdaBoost Classifier

We propose a Trace-distance binary Tree AdaBoost (TTA) multi-class quantum classifier, a practical pipeline for quantum multi-class classification that combines quantum-aware reductions with ensemble learning to improve trainability and resource efficiency. TTA builds a hierarchical binary tree by choosing, at each internal node, the bipartition that maximizes the trace distance between average quantum states; each node trains a binary AdaBoost ensemble of shallow variational quantum base learners. By confining intrinsically hard, small trace distance distinctions to small node-specific…

In this work we develop a real-time Schwinger-Keldysh formulation of Krylov dynamics that treats Krylov complexity as an in-in observable generated by a closed time contour path integral. The resulting generating functional exposes an emergent phase-space description in which the Lanczos coefficients define an effective Hamiltonian governing operator motion along the Krylov chain. In the semiclassical limit, exponential complexity growth arises from hyperbolic trajectories, and asymptotically linear Lanczos growth appears as a universal chaotic fixed point, with sub-leading deformations…

Self-supervised learning (SSL) faces a fundamental conflict between semantic understanding and image reconstruction. High-level semantic SSL (e.g., DINO) relies on global tokens that are forced to be location-invariant for augmentation alignment, a process that inherently discards the spatial coordinates required for reconstruction. Conversely, generative SSL (e.g., MAE) preserves dense feature grids for reconstruction but fails to produce high-level abstractions. We introduce STELLAR, a framework that resolves this tension by factorizing visual features into a low-rank product of semantic…
